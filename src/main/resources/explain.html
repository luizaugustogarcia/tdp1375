            <h1>Proof syntax</h1>

            The case analysis is performed by extending the configurations that do not have $\frac{11}{8}$-sequences
            or presenting it, case the configuration has a $\frac{11}{8}$-sequence.
            <p>Note that several configurations are equivalent under circular shifts and mirroring. When performing
                computations, the proof generator only takes one representative of a set of equivalent configurations,
                called <i>canonical configuration</i>. This configuration is selected as the one with the least
                associated hash code, among its equivalent ones.
            <p>Each generated configuration have its own HTML file, which can be either a file presenting a
                $\frac{11}{8}$-sequence or a list of all possible extensions of it.
            <p>It is important to note that, although each file of the proof presents one or more graphs, the method
                employed in this work do not rely on them. We have decided to present the graph aiming to facilitate the
                understanding of the proof for the readers used to the formalisms based on the cycle graph.

            <h1>Extension files</h1>

            The extension file starts presenting a cycle graph corresponding to the analysed configuration. Then we
            present its <i>hash code</i> and a list containing the indices of its <i>open gates</i>. The
            <i>signature</i> of the configuration is presented. The signature is computed first assigning a label (a
            integer value) to each cycle in the $\spi$, according to the order of appearance of its symbols in $\epi$.
            Then, we map each symbol of $\epi$ to the label of the $\epi$ cycle which contains that symbol. In case of
            oriented cycles, we add to the mapped value, a fractional corresponding to the ordinal position of the
            symbol in $\epi$. Then, the <i>3-norm</i> is presented.

            <p>Following, the extensions grouped by <i>Type</i> are presented. Each extension starts with the indices
                (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>) where the new symbols were inserted into the extended configuration.
                Then, the proof tells if the extension is either <i>BAD</i> or <i>GOOD</i>, highlighted in red and green,
                respectively.
                Bad extensions do not have $\frac{11}{8}$-sequences, while the good ones do. This information is
                followed by the hash code, $3$-norm and signature of the extension. Next, we present a link with the new
                $\spi$ generated by directly from the insertion of new symbols into the extended configuration (and not
                its canonical representative). Clicking this link opens a popup window with its associated graph.

            <p>Finally, a link to the <i>canonical configuration</i> of the extension allows the reader to visualise
                either a $\frac{11}{8}$-sequence file, case the extension is good, or another extension file, otherwise.

            <h1>$\frac{11}{8}$-sequence files</h1>

            The $\frac{11}{8}$-sequence file first present a graph of the associated configuration. Then, for each
            transposition $\tau_i$, in the sequence, represented as a $3$-cycle, it shows $\tau_i$, the permutation
            $\spi{\tau_1}^{-1}\dots{\tau_i}^{-1}$ and the graph corresponding to $\spi{\tau_1}^{-1}\dots{\tau_i}^{-1}$.
