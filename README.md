# SBT 1375

Algorithm for sorting by transpositions based on an [algebraic approach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) with guarantee of [approximation ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm) of 1.375 for all permutations in the [Symmetric Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group). For the details on the algorithm, please refer to the paper [A new 1.375-approximation algorithm for Sorting By Transpositions](https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-022-00205-z) by L. A. G. Silva, L. A. B. Kowada, N. R. Rocco and M. E. M. T. Walter.

This project requires Maven version 3.6.3+ and Java JDK 11+.

Before running any of the commands below, first compile the project using the command 

`mvn compile`

To execute the proposed algorithm, run the command 
  
 `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="br.unb.cic.tdp.Silvaetal" -Dexec.args="<first_arg>"` 
  
where the first argument is the permutation to be sorted, e.g, `20,10,14,1,7,9,5,3,17,6,15,19,13,16,12,4,11,8,2,18` (longer random permutations [here](https://github.com/luizaugustogarcia/tdp1375/tree/master/src/main/resources/datasets) - disregard the first zeros). Note that, before executing the algorithm itself, the program has to load into memory all cases generated in the case analysis. This demands a significant amount of memory (~2GB) (it takes about 15 seconds to complete on a computer equipped with an 11th Gen Intel Core i9-11950H processor with 32GB DDR4 RAM and a NVMe SSD hard disk). Therefore, we suggest, before running the algorithm, to increase the memory available to at least 2GB, by setting the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2G".

Now, to execute the program that generates the case analysis, which is the base of the correctness proof of the algorithm, run the command

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="br.unb.cic.tdp.proof.ProofGenerator" -Dexec.args="<first_arg>"`

where the first argument indicates the directory which the proof will be generated into.

> Note: the command above will use all CPU cores of the host machine and can take hours or even days to finish, depending on the CPU power

The case analysis generated by the command above is hosted [here](http://tdp1375proof.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/).
