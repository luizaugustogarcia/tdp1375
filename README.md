# tdp1375
Algorithm for sorting by transpositions with guarantee of approximation ratio of 1.375

This project requires Maven.

The class "br.unb.cic.tdp1375.Sorting1375" implements the algorithm proposed by Silva et al.

To run the project:

1. Copy the content of "tdp1375/deps/" folder to your .m2 folder
2. Uncompress the two files "case*.tar.gz", each one into a different folder
3. Run the main method of br.unb.cic.tdp1375.Sorting1375 passing as parameters: the folder for unoriented cases (first parameter), the folder for the oriented cases (second parameter) and the permutation to sort (thierd and last parameter), e.g., 0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.
